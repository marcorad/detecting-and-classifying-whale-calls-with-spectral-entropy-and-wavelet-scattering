Comments from the Editors and Reviewers:




Reviewer 1:

The authors have not used a published implementation of WS, but have written their own implementation. I have no problem with this in principle but I haven't found the source code as supplementary material. Thus, I cannot check the faithfulness of the implementation.

The discussion on WS suffers from an ambiguity in the use of "critical downsampling". In published implementation (ScatNet, scattering.m, Kymatio), critical downsampling is path-specific, i.e., dependent on lambda. Meanwhile, the authors define the downsampling factor d as path-agnostic downsampling (between Equations 4 and 5). This is critical downsampling for lambda_max but is oversampling for lambda < lambda_max. As a result, Equation 6 is much more computationally intensive than in published implementations. This kind of ambiguity would have easily been clarified if the authors had published their code.

Zero mean is not sufficient to ensure wavelet admissibility. Read Mallat's Wavelet Tour 4.3.

There is also an ambiguity surrounding the fact that the same Greek letter \psi is used for both layers even so Q1≠Q2. We can live with that abuse of notation but it would be good to warn the reader about it.

Equation 10 does not seem necessary to me as the authors do not go beyond order 2 for this paper.

What is the unit of T? A standard deviation of T/2pi seconds suggests that T is in seconds per radian, but a cutoff frequency of 1/T suggests that T is in seconds.

"In the implementation for this paper, all filters are exponentially spaced" --> indeed this differs from ScatNet (Andén and Mallat 2011) but matches scattering.m (Lostanlen and Mallat 2015 and later).

Concepts such as "information leakage" are imprecise.

The spectral entropy approach for wavelet scattering features is novel and interesting. I encourage authors to highlight this section.

> We utilise the amplitude spectra in this estimation, as we find this works better in practise as squaring increases the noise variance and amplifies outliers.

Although there is value behind saying "we find this works better in practice" (with a C !), this is not what theory says. Read Siddiqui 1962 "Some problems connected with Rayleigh distributions" and later papers on the same topic. I quote: "The Rayleigh power is a multiple of chi-square with 2 degrees of freedom, whereas the Rayleigh amplitude is a multiple of chi. The properties of the Rayleigh power distribution are much neater and better suited for statistical estimation and for testing of hypotheses than the properties of the Rayleigh amplitude distribution". The authors should discuss established knowledge in statistics before reporting empirical findings.

An argument going in the favor of authors is Liutkus and Badeau: "Generalized Wiener filtering with fractional power spectrograms" ICASSP 2015 https://hal.science/hal-01146004

Equation 19 is a missed opportunity to discuss the connection with PCEN, now a well-established method for adaptive gain control in machine learning for bioacoustics.

The introduction and discussion of state of the art is sometimes dogmatic:
> very accurate NN approaches exist for a variety of species, but require large datasets and careful data preparation
There is a new generation of deep neural networks for few-shot bioacoustics which circumvent this problem. Read Nolasco et al. "Learning to detect an animal sound from five examples"


> Non-NN approaches have also obtained very accurate results, most of which utilise Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) as features
This description seems biased against NN's. In fact the scattering transform was initially developed to circumvent the shortcomings of MFCC-GMM-HMM pipelines in speech and audio processing.



Reviewer 2: Review of "Detecting and Classifying Whale Calls with Wavelet Scattering and Spectral Entropy"

I'll admit not being enthusiastic about reviewing a detection/classification paper on baleen whale calls: there have been numerous papers on the topic over the past 20 years that have often been supplanted by more modern machine learning methods. However, these approaches still have value in helping to derive larger training sets needed for advanced machine learning (e.g. neural networks), as well, as exploratory analysis of small data sets, and so continued progress on "simple" approaches are welcome.


Despite my initial reluctance, I warmed up to the paper as I went along, because it is well written and gives a fair introduction of "wavelet scattering" methods (basically taking sequences of continuous wavelet transforms of an image to strip away small-scale variations in structure), and the performance of the WS/SE approach over standard "BLED" methods seems significant enough to warrant publication. However, there are some gaps in the paper in terms of references, analysis, and description that I would characterize as "major revision" but the system only allows me to say "reconsider". I also wonder if the portions of the proposed algorithm are needlessly complex when compared to performance gain.

My comments, starting from major to minor, are below:

(1) Detection: The algorithms described here (WS vs SE) are quite complicated, but Figure 6 (the heart of the paper) suggested that the major improvement in performance is a simple pre-whitening (or equalization) across the frequency spectrum, as well as adaptive thresholding (performed by a complicated Gaussian Mixture Model (line 249). For example, even a simple "energy detector" (labeled BLED here) has an enormous improvement when pre-whitened. What is the performance of a BLED when adaptive thresholding is also included (i.e. a "BLED GMM White")? In other words, what does the use of WS vs. standard FFT really gain you?

Also, what is the computational load of using WS vs standard short term fourier transform (STFT) techniques?

(2) Other algorithms: Another standard simple detector is the "Nuthall" or "power law" detector, that basically uses various powers of the FFT spectrum. See for example, this reference below. Any new proposed simple detector should also compare with this technique (which basically also found that pre-whitening and noise equalization were the key to performance).

https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-abstract/131/4/2682/830904/A-generalized-power-law-detection-algorithm-for?redirectedFrom=fulltext


(3) Metrics for evaluation: An accepted practice for evaluating passive acoustic detectors is via the "precision" and "recall" instead of "false alarm" and "miss rate". I suggest the authors look over this paper and also present results in terms of precision and recall:

https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article/151/1/414/2838133


(4) The GMM thresholding technique seems overly complicated for an adaptive threshold approach. Why not just specify a desired "signal to noise ratio" and have the threshold be based on this, rather than trying to fit a GMM model to the background noise estimates? Using the GMM seems to require all sorts of additional hyper parameters and the need for "fudging" the distributions via Eqs. (25) and (26).

(5) The description of the "classification" section is abbreviated and unsatisfactory compared to the detection section. In particular, the linear discrimant analysis section is vague. Lines 416-418, which describe the feature selection strategy using chi-square testing, needs to be expanded to a paragraph and clarified.

(6) The authors complain about the poor quality of the human annotations of the dataset, leading to an apparent underperformance of the classification algorithm (since unmarked legit whale calls exist in the data). The time needed to "repair" the annotations by another manual review doesn't seem to be terribly long, compared to the effort required to work around it, and would strengthen the conclusions of the classification section.

(7) Table III: The hyper parameters (alpha and gamma) needed for optimal performance seem to jump around a lot depending on the fraction of dataset used for training, particularly gamma. That doesn't bode well for robustness of the algorithm to novel data? However, how important is the exact value of gamma on the performance?


Minor coments:
(a) peer-reviewed reference needed for Anne and Mallat (2013)
(b) Lines 417-418 are incomprehensible
(c) The mathematical notation for the WS is difficult to follow and certain symbols are undefined. For example, the '*' symbol is never explicitly defined as convolution. Instead of Figure 3 I think a demonstration image of S1 and S2 scattering amplitudes for a single (or two) calls would be more instructive.




Reviewer's Responses to Questions

Is the manuscript of good scientific quality, free from errors, misconceptions or ambiguities; does it present original work; and does it contain sufficient new results, new applications or new developments of reasonable enough significance to warrant its publication in JASA? Please indicate in your report (in detailed comments, below) any points which are objectionable or which need attention.

Reviewer #1: The manuscript is of unequal scientific quality. The authors have clearly made efforts to understand and summarize the mathematical details of the wavelet scattering (WS), which is my area of expertise. However, major problems remain in the presentation of methods.

WS and bioacoustic detection have long been studied separately, but noever in conjunction. Hence, this paper has an element of originality and novelty, warranting its publication in JASA.

However, some points are objectionable in the comparison with the state of the art, as listed below.

Reviewer #2: Paper may have incrementally interesting results for "simple" detection and classification of baleen whale calls to be considered for JASA publication, but see main comments below.

--------------------

Is JASA an appropriate journal in which to present this work? In this regard, please consider carefully the commitment of JASA to publish work that is within the scope of Acoustics. Does the content of the manuscript, including terminology and the references cited, meet this criterion?

Reviewer #1: Yes, JASA is appropriate as this paper deals with computational methods in bioacoustics.

Reviewer #2: Yes, in fact paper almost serves as a tutorial for wavelet scattering representations of acoustic data.

--------------------

Is the manuscript a clear, concise, reasonably self-contained presentation of the material, giving adequate references to related work? Is the English satisfactory? Please indicate needed changes in your report.

Reviewer #1: The English is satisfactory. I have found a single typo ("in practise" -> "in practice")


Some references are missing. In particular

> Napoli, A., & White, P. R. (2023). Unsupervised domain adaptation for the cross-dataset detection of humpback whale calls. Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events.

which looks very relevant in terms of scope.

Reviewer #2: Manuscript is exceptionally well written, but mathematical notation is unclear in spots (especially for wavelet scattering section).

--------------------

Are the tables and figures clear and relevant, and are the captions adequate? Are there either too many or too few? If any of the figures are in color, is the color essential for conveying the scientific point?

Reviewer #1: Figure 6 should recall the meaning of every acronym in the caption.

Reviewer #2: Figure 3 should be switched for a visual example of WS in action (see below).

--------------------

If Supplementary material was submitted, is it relevant to the manuscript and should it be deposited in the Supplemental Depository for reference to the manuscript?

Reviewer #1: I regret the absence of source code as supplementary material!

Reviewer #2: NA

--------------------

Does the paper make effective use of journal space, or are parts unnecessary, unimportant, or subject to condensation? If so, which?

Reviewer #1: I can't comment on GMM's as I am not a specialist. I will point out that this portion of the paper is incremental from an other publication from the same authors, so the details should be kept to a minimum. Overall, the paper is very long and at times loses focus.

Reviewer #2: If anything, more detail is needed in classification section.

--------------------

Is the title appropriate and the abstract adequate for verbatim reproduction in abstract journals? IMPORTANT: The lead paragraph should advertise the main points of the article and must describe in terms accessible to the general reader the context and significance or the research problem studied and the importance of the results.

Reviewer #1: The title is appropriate.

Reviewer #2: Exactly what is says on the label.
